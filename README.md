# Dismounter
A simple and minimalistic wow classic addon to dismount, cancel shapeshift and stand up everytime you get that annoying error message saying `You are mounted/shapeshifted/not standing` 

# TODO
- [ ] Cast spell after you dismount
- [x] Fly to your destination after you dismount at flight master
- [ ] Remove shapeshifting aswell
